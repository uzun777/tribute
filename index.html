            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
              Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, Transvaal, South
              Africa, the son of Maye Musk (n√©e Haldeman), a model and dietitian
              from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and Errol Musk, a South African
              electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. He has a younger
              brother, Kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, Tosca (born
              1974). His maternal grandfather, Dr. Joshua Haldeman, was an
              American-born Canadian. His paternal grandmother was British, and
              he also has Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry. After his parents
              divorced in 1980, Musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs
              of Pretoria, which Musk chose two years after his parents split
              up, but now Musk says it was a mistake. As an adult, Musk has
              severed relations with his father, whom he has referred to as "a
              terrible human being". He has a half-sister and a
              half-brother. During his childhood, Musk was an avid reader.
              At the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the
              Commodore VIC-20. He taught himself computer programming at the
              age of 10, and by the age of 12 sold the code of a BASIC-based
              video game he created called Blastar, to a magazine called PC and
              Office Technology, for approximately $500. A web version of the
              game is available online. His childhood reading included Isaac
              Asimov's Foundation series, from which he drew the lesson that
              "you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to
              prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and
              reduce the length of a dark age if there is one." Musk was
              severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once
              hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of
              stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost
              consciousness. He later revealed that he had to get a nose job, to
              repair the damage. Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory
              School and Bryanston High School before graduating from Pretoria
              Boys High School. Although Musk's father insisted that Elon go to
              college in Pretoria, Musk became determined to move to the United
              States. As he states, "I remember thinking and seeing that America
              is where great things are possible, more than any other country in
              the world." Knowing it would be easy to get to the United States
              from Canada, he moved to Canada against his father's wishes in
              June 1989, just before his 18th birthday, after obtaining a
              Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
              At the age of 17, in 1989, Elon Musk moved to Canada to attend
              Queen's University, avoiding mandatory service in the South
              African military. He left in 1992 to study business and physics at
              the University of Pennsylvania, and graduated with an
              undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second
              bachelor's degree in physics. After leaving Penn, Elon Musk headed
              to Stanford University in California to pursue a PhD in energy
              physics. However, his move coincided with the Internet boom, and
              he dropped out of Stanford after just two days to become a part of
              it, launching his first company, Zip2 Corporation.

                <h3>Zip2</h3>
                <p>
                  In 1995, Musk and his brother, Kimbal, started Zip2, a web
                  software company, with money raised from a small group of
                  angel investors. The company developed and marketed an
                  Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry.
                  Musk obtained contracts with The New York Times and the
                  Chicago Tribune and persuaded the board of directors to
                  abandon plans for a merger with CitySearch. While at Zip2,
                  Musk wanted to become CEO; however, none of the board members
                  would allow it. Compaq acquired Zip2 for US$307 million in
                  cash and US$34 million in stock options in February 1999. Musk
                  received US$22 million for his 7 percent share from the sale.

                <h3>X.com and PayPal</h3>
                <p>
                  In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial
                  services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from
                  the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with
                  Confinity, which had a money-transfer service called PayPal.
                  The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was
                  renamed PayPal in 2001. PayPal's early growth was driven
                  mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were
                  recruited when they received money through the service. Musk
                  was ousted in October 2000 from his role as CEO (although he
                  remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company
                  leadership, notably over his desire to move PayPal's
                  Unix-based infrastructure to Microsoft Windows. In October
                  2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock,
                  of which Musk received US$165 million. Before its sale, Musk,
                  who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of
                  PayPal's shares. In July 2017, Musk purchased the domain x.com
                  from PayPal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has
                  sentimental value to him.
